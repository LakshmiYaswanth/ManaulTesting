# what is defect and bug.
The variation between the actual results and expected results is known as defect.
If a developer finds an issue and corrects it by himself in the development phase then itâ€™s called a defect.
# bug
If testers find any mismatch in the application/system in testing phase then they call it as Bug.
As I mentioned earlier, there is a contradiction in the usage of Bug and Defect. People widely say the bug is an informal name for the defect.
